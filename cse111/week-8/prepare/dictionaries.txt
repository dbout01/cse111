DICTIONARIES
A Python program can store many items in a dictionary.
    Each item in a dictionary is a key value pair.
        Each key within a dictionary must be unique.

MEANING...
No key can appear more than once in a dictionary.
    Values within a dictionary do not have to be unique.
        Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are created.

CREATING A DICTIONARY:
variable_dict = {....}

ADDING ITEM TO EXISTING DICTIONARY:
    dictionary_name[key] = value

TO CHECK IF A KEY IS STORED IN A DICTIONARY:
    if key in dictionary_name:
    
FIND A KEY AND ITS CORRESPONDING VALUE:
    value = dictionary_name[key]

COMPOUND VALUES
- A value that has parts
- Each key is a single string, and each value is a single string.
- It is possible to store compound values in a dictionary.
- Because each list contains multiple parts, we say that the dictionary stores compound values.

FINDING ONE ITEM
    value = dictionary_name[key]

PROCESSING ALL ITEMS
- Processing all the items in a dictionary is different than finding one item in a dictionary.
- Processing all the items is done using a for loop and the dict.items().
How to do it: for key, value in students_dict.items():

CONVERTING BETWEEN LISTS & DICTIONARIES
- It is possible to convert two lists into a dictionary by using the built-in zip and dict functions.
- The contents of the first list will become the keys in the dictionary, and the contents of the
  second list will become the values.
    - This implies that the two lists must have the same length, and the elements in the first list must
      be unique because keys in a dictionary must be unique.

It is also possible to convert a dictionary into two lists by using the keys and values methods and the built-in list function.

SUMMARY
- A dictionary in a Python program can store many pieces of data called items.
- An item is a key value pair.
    Each key that is stored in a dictionary must be unique.
- Values do not have to be unique.
- To create a dictionary, we use curly braces ({ and }).
    - To add an item and find an item in a dictionary, we use the square brackets ([ and ]) and a key.
    - To process all items in a dictionary, we write a for each loop.
    - Dictionaries were invented to enable a computer to find items very quickly.
    - Do not write a for each loop to find an item in a dictionary.
        - To find an item in a dictionary, use square brackets ([ and ]) and a key.
