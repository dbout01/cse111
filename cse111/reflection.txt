Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
    This semester, the experience I had was when working on the "chemistry" assingment from weeks 7 and 8. I feel like the chemistry assingment
    was the hardest assignment for me to complete, but looking back at it, I see the power of functions and how they allow (sometimes complex) operations 
    to be performed, even with data that needs to be displayed (through a dictionary/composite dictionary).


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
    Test functions hold significant value in the software development process.
    They allow developers to verify that their codes runs as expected.
    By systematically testing different scenarios, including both valid and invalid inputs,
    test functions can help catch bugs. Test functions provide reassurance that the program functions
    as intended, improve code quality, and aid in maintaining the stability and reliability of a program.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
    When troubleshooting and fixing a program, my process usually is:
        1. Identifying the problem by reproducing the issue and understanding what caused them
        2. Analyzing the  code to identify potential causes
        3. Isolating the broken section of the code and debugging it
        4. Using any necessary fixes or modifications
        5. Testing the modified code to ensure the issue has been resolved
