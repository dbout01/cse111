CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
    "UniData"

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    The program will address the real-world problem of efficiently managing and retrieving information
    from a university database. It will help automate tasks related to accessing and manipulating data stored
    in the university's database system, making it easier for administrators, faculty, and students to retrieve
    relevant information. This program will be a complement to my CIT111 Course, in which I am creating a University
    database for my final project.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    By developing this program, I will gain a deeper understanding of working with databases,
    handling data retrieval and manipulation using Python, and implementing efficient data processing techniques.
    Additionally, I will learn about integrating Python with database systems and developing modular code
    for better code organization.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
          - mysql-connector-python: for connecting to and interacting with MySQL database.
          - datetime: for working with dates and times.
          - random: for generating random data or selecting random elements.
          - pytest: for writing and executing unit tests.
          - any other relevant modules depending on any incoming needs in the program.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
    Yes, I will separate my Python program into functions that each perform a single task.
    This approach will promote code readability, making it easier to maintain and test the program.
    By breaking down the program into functions, I can focus on specific tasks such as database
    connection, data retrieval, data manipulation, and data presentation.

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?
    Yes, I will write test functions to test at least two of the program functions.
    Testing the functions will help ensure their correctness and identify any potential issues or bugs.
    The tests can include verifying the expected output of a function given specific input,
    checking for boundary cases, and handling potential errors or exceptions.
    Writing tests will prevent me from causing major errors in my program.
